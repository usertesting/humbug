humbug
======

A self-contained widget you can add to any iOS project that provides Pivotal Tracker integration and [FLEX](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLEX) debugging tools. Include it in beta builds to see consistent bug reports with logs and screen shots from your testers.

### Installation
Requires iOS 7 and later

* clone the repository.
* cd into the humbug folder and run git submodule init and git submodule update to pull down the dependencies.
* Drag the 'App' folder into your project.
* Drag Externals/FLEX/Classes and Externals/MBProgressHUD/MBProgressHUD.h/.m into your project if necessary.
* Link against libz.dylib (used to compress log files).
*initialize the BUGViewController by passing in your pivotal tracker api token, project ID, and optionally a block that returns your logs as a NSData.

######Pivotal Tracker Info
Your [Pivotal Tracker API Token](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/faq#wherecanifindmyapitoken) can be found at the bottom of your Pivotal Tracker 'Profile' page. Your Pivotal Tracker Project ID is the number in the URL for you Tracker project's page (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/123456).

######Excluding Humbug From AppStore Builds
humbug should only be included in non-AppStore builds as FLEX will cause an AppStore rejection. To exclude the files from your AppStore builds:

* Go to your project's build settings and click 'Add User-Defined Setting'. Name the settings key ```EXCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES``` then, for your release configuration, add ```FLEX* BUG* UIWindow+BUG*``` as its value. 
* Wrap all Humbug file imports and method calls in a #if DEBUG check:

```objc
#ifdef DEBUG
	#import "BUGViewController.h"
	#import "DDFileLogger.h"
#endif

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    #ifdef DEBUG
    [BUGViewController createSharedInstanceWithLogFileData:^NSData *{
        DDFileLogger *fileLogger;
        for (id logger in Flywheel.sharedInstance.loggers) {
            if ([logger isKindOfClass:[DDFileLogger class]]) {
                fileLogger = logger;
            }
        }
        NSData *fileData;
        if ([fileLogger.logFileManager sortedLogFilePaths].count) {
            fileData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:[fileLogger.logFileManager sortedLogFilePaths][0]];
        }
        return fileData;
    } trackerAPIToken:@"your-pivotal-tracker-api-token" trackerProjectID:@"your-project-id"];
    #endif
}
```

### Usage
Once initialized, humbug can be activated out of the box by shaking your device or by calling ```[BUGViewController showHideDebugViewController]```.
If you would like to disable the 'shake to reveal humbug' feature, just remove "UIWindow+BUG.m" from your apps' compile sources.
